•	For Part 1, first I downloaded the data file as raw as provided in the link.
•	For the out how many rows in the csv file I used length function.
•	I used isnumeric function to remove all rows with profit that is not numerica value. 
•	For 2nd part the output produced in the part 1, has been converted into json format using json library. I have used json.dump function to do so.
•	To print the top 20 rows with highest profit values I have used lambda function and then returned only top 20.
•	Desired outputs are obtained and data2.json file is also produced.
